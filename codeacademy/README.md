### Keys
A list needs keys if either of the following are true:

1. The list-items have memory from one render to the next. For instance, when a to-do list renders, each item must “remember” whether it was checked off. The items shouldn’t get amnesia when they render.
2. A list’s order might be shuffled. For instance, a list of search results might be shuffled from one render to the next.
